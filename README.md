This game was made for the GamesPlusJam 2021! It is a 2D Platformer about Mt. Better-Than-Everest, a new mountain formed due to the shifting of the tectonic plates. 
It is 25% taller than Mt Everest, hence the name. A bounty goes out: The first person to scale the mountain will receive $1,000,000 as a reward! 
You play as Jack, who will tackle the challenge of scaling the mountain along with your partner, Kelsey.
